/* gpu_arena.c -- heap wrappers: a dedicated GPU arena, plus a free() guard.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS LOAD-BEARING. It is not diagnostics.
 *
 * libdrm_nouveau backs EVERY GPU buffer with memalign(0x1000, size) before
 * nvMapCreate/nvAddressSpaceMap. Those allocations are large (up to ~22MB),
 * page-aligned, and churned constantly, so serving them from newlib's general
 * heap shreds it: once fragmented, a 21MB CONTIGUOUS page-aligned run cannot be
 * placed even with a gigabyte free in aggregate. memalign then returns NULL ->
 * nouveau_bo_new fails -> texStorage reports GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY -> incomplete FBO
 * -> BLACK SCREEN.
 *
 * So we reserve one big contiguous region ONCE at first use, before the heap has
 * been churned, and hand GPU buffers out of it with a page bitmap. They can
 * never fragment newlib and newlib can never fragment them. Anything that is not
 * a large page-aligned request falls straight through to newlib.
 *
 * The Makefile's -Wl,--wrap flags are what route allocations here, including
 * mesa's own internal ones. THE WRAP LIST AND THE FUNCTIONS BELOW MUST AGREE:
 * a --wrap with no __wrap_ function is an undefined-reference link error from
 * libEGL.a, and a __wrap_ function with no --wrap is silently dead code. If you
 * add or remove one, do both.
 *
 * Carried over from the reference port essentially unchanged -- this is engine-
 * and driver-level behaviour, not title-specific. The canary machinery it also
 * contained is left in but DISABLED (see CANARY_ENABLE): it was built to hunt a
 * corruption that turned out to be a nouveau_mm_allocate bug, since fixed, and
 * its +8-byte tail sat directly in the GPU allocation path. Re-arm it only if a
 * real heap corruption shows up.
 *
 * MIT.

/* ---- heap-corruption guard (save-load asset processing) --------------------
 * A crash on UnityMain inside _free_r showed free() handed 0x3d636c1c3d1fcf53 --
 * packed float RGBA data, not a heap pointer. An object's pointer field had been
 * overwritten by asset/texture float data (a buffer overrun during save load),
 * and freeing that garbage faulted. We can't yet localize the overrun, but we can
 * keep it from being fatal: with -Wl,--wrap,free in the Makefile, EVERY free()
 * call routes here first -- libunity/il2cpp frees (via the &free import table
 * entry, which --wrap redirects to __wrap_free) AND mesa's own internal frees.
 * A real malloc() result is 8-byte aligned and inside the 39-bit user address
 * space; a smashed pointer is neither, so we skip it (leaking the block) and log
 * instead of crashing in _free_r. Fast integer checks only -- no syscall on the
 * hot path, which matters because asset load frees heavily. If a subtler
 * corruption (aligned + in-range but non-heap) ever slips through, add an
 * svcQueryMemory readability tier here. */

/* ---- heap overrun hunter (canaries) ----------------------------------------
 * The free-guard above proved a heap buffer overrun exists (pointer fields
 * smashed with float RGBA during asset processing); it has now graduated to
 * smashing mesa's GL buffer bookkeeping -> the recurring glBufferData faults
 * at round/garbage destinations. Catch the overrunner: every allocation gets
 * an 8-byte tail canary (size+8 alloc, XOR-keyed to the pointer) tracked in a
 * lossy side table; a sweeper thread checks live canaries every 2s and
 * __wrap_free checks at free. On a smash we log the block size and the first
 * 32 bytes written PAST the block -- the content names the writer.
 * The side table is alignment-neutral (no headers), so memalign semantics are
 * preserved; collisions just evict tracking (lossy is fine for hunting). */
