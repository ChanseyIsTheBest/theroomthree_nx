/* playgames_stub.c -- keep The Room Three's Google Play Games / CloudSave path
 * dormant, so the game runs entirely on local saves.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The Room Three's cloud save is driven by com.google.android.gms.tasks
 * CALLBACKS, not return values: the C# registers AndroidJavaProxy objects
 * implementing OnCompleteListener / OnSuccessListener / OnFailureListener and
 * then waits. Handing back a null sign-in client (which is what our JNI layer
 * does, since there are no Play Services here) means no listener ever fires --
 * so CloudSave.UpdateFinished() can stay false forever and a loading state can
 * hang. Returning a *live* client would be worse: it pushes the game into code
 * that genuinely cannot work.
 *
 * Fortunately the game gates the entire path behind two PlayerPrefs keys, both
 * confirmed as string literals in this build's global-metadata.dat:
 *
 *     UseGooglePlay   -- SocialPlatformManager.AutoSignInPref
 *                        read by ShouldAutoSignIn()
 *     CloudEnabled    -- CloudSave.CloudEnabledPref
 *                        read by IsCloudPlayerPrefEnabled()
 *
 * With both at 0, SocialPlatformManager.ShouldAutoSignIn() is false and
 * CloudSave.IsCloudAvailable() is false.
 *
 * IMPORTANT -- THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON ITS OWN, and an earlier version of this
 * comment wrongly claimed it was. Seeding these keys stops the GAME asking for a
 * sign-in, but the Google Play Games plugin bootstraps ITSELF from
 * PlayGamesHelperObject.Update() and calls AndroidClient.Authenticate regardless
 * of any game pref. Observed on hardware: the prefs were both 0 and the plugin
 * still ran. The sign-in Task must therefore be completed properly in
 * jni_fake.c (see gpgs_complete_signin) -- that is what actually keeps the game
 * out of a soft-lock. These prefs remain useful for the game's own cloud UI. The
 * relevant managed surface -- every entry point a clean boolean gate with a
 * failure branch -- is:
 *
 *     SocialPlatformManager : MonoBehaviour
 *         ShouldAutoSignIn()   IsGooglePlayAvailable()   IsUserAuthenticated()
 *         GetIsSigningIn()     ProcessAuthentication(bool success)
 *     CloudSave
 *         IsCloudAvailable()   IsCloudPlayerPrefEnabled()
 *         GetCloudEnabled()    UpdateFinished()
 *
 * Fireproof wrote this to survive Play Services being absent, which is exactly
 * our situation. We only have to make sure it starts in that state.
 *
 * We seed the keys by writing prefs.kv directly BEFORE unity_jni.c loads it,
 * and only when the file does not already exist -- so a player who later turns
 * cloud on in-game (and gets it turned straight back off by the failing sign-in)
 * keeps whatever the game last wrote. Never clobber an existing save.
 *
 * prefs.kv format (see unity_jni.c): one record per line, "T\tkey\tval\n",
 * where T is S/I/L/F/B. Unity's PlayerPrefs has no bool, so both gates are
 * ints written through putInt -> 'I'.
 *
 * MIT.
