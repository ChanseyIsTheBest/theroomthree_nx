/* UnitySendMessage(const char *gameObject, const char *method, const char *param)
 *
 * Resolved BY NAME, not by offset: libunity exports it (.dynsym, 0xcc bytes at
 * +0x6b6428 in this build). Using the export means this survives a libunity
 * update, so unlike the rest of nx_patch_r3.h there is no constant to
 * re-derive and nothing for verify_offsets.py to check.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY -- derived, not assumed. The export does not dispatch into
 * scripting; it builds a message struct on its stack and appends it to a queue
 * under a lock. Disassembled:
 *
 *     UnitySendMessage:  ... bl <build msg> ; bl <get queue> ; bl 0x6b65dc
 *     0x6b65dc:          bl 0xb981c8   -> pthread_mutex_lock
 *                        <append entries to the vector at [queue+0x58]>
 *                        b  0xb981d0   -> pthread_mutex_unlock
 *
 * So this is a mutex-guarded deferred enqueue and is safe to call from any
 * thread -- which matters, because on Android these callbacks arrive on Java
 * threads, and our JNI stubs run on whatever thread the game called from. The
 * message is delivered on the main thread during the next player-loop
 * iteration, exactly as on Android.
