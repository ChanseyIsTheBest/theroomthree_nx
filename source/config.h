 * must return to 256MB, and vice versa. A mismatch means the arena hands back
 * regions the allocator then overlaps; the reference port recorded exactly
 * that failure (16MB -> corrupted Dynamic Heap at init, null-prev free-list
 * crash), so 64MB is also the known-good floor -- do not go lower. */
#define MMAP_ARENA_RESERVE  ((size_t)192 * 1024 * 1024)   // heap-backed spill cap (3x64MB). INHERITED TUNING -- the prose history in the reference config referred to values (1024/896/512) that no longer match this constant; treat the number, not the story, as authoritative and re-check on hardware.

// Stack-region overcommit (OC) arena (see libc_shim.c): PROT_NONE reservations
// held in a stack-region window, committed pages backed from a small heap pool.
#define OC_WINDOW_BYTES     ((size_t)2048 * 1024 * 1024)  // 32x64MB cheap PROT_NONE reservation. Was 1536; the window-finder clamps to the largest stack-region hole (min(this, hole)), so raising the cap lets a run use its full hole and spill fewer reservations into the (real-memory) arena.
// Commit-pool: real memory backing touched pages of the OC window. Unity is told it
// has 512 MB (libc_shim.c __sysconf PHYS_PAGES + dalvik.vm.heapsize), and it reserves
// its heaps as big PROT_NONE regions that route here, so this pool must be able to
// back the full 512 MB Unity believes it has -- at 256 MB the scene load exhausted it
// (~270 MB working set) and the next uncommitted page faulted -> hard OOM crash.
// malloc. UPDATE 2: trimming the pool 1280->1024 + arena 1024->512 fixed the malloc
// OOM (malloc 1409 -> game pushed past the null-buffer crash) but 512 starved the
// arena (see above). Final balance within the ~2945 MB (newlib+arena) budget:
// pool 896 + arena 896 + malloc 1153. Each sits ~1.6-1.8x above its known failure
// point (pool live 551 / arena fail 512 / malloc fail 641). If one OOMs again the
// log names which knob to grow.
/* OC commit-pool (touched pages only). NO LONGER INHERITED TUNING -- MEASURED.
 *
 * Was 896 MB, carried over as 1.6x PvZ Fusion's 551 MB working set, with the
 * note that The Room Three "is a far smaller title, so this should be generous" and
 * that the value could only be settled on hardware. It has now been settled:
 * across three boots, including one that reached the title screen and menus,
 * the pool peaked at
 *
 *     218 MB, 218 MB, 240 MB   (of 896)
 *
 * so 896 was ~3.7x the real working set. 512 is 2.1x the observed peak -- still
 * generous for a title whose peak moved only 22 MB between a short boot and a
 * long one -- and returns 384 MB to the newlib heap.
 *
 * That matters because the pool is `memalign(0x1000, OC_POOL_BYTES)` out of the
 * SAME newlib heap the GPU arena reserves from, so this is the memory that
 * funds GPUA_BYTES at 1080p (imports_r3_extra.c). If a future title stalls or
 * the "[oc] committed" line ever approaches this cap, raise it -- the log
 * prints pool usage on every commit, so it is directly observable. */

/* Graphics-driver headroom, held back from the newlib heap.
 *
 * __libnx_initheap took everything except the stock 0x200000 (2 MB).
 * switch-mesa and the nouveau/nvidia layer allocate GPU memory from the SAME
 * process pool -- NOT from our GPU arena, which only ever sees what comes
 * through memalign. A single 1920x1080 RGBA swapchain buffer is ~8 MB, so a
 * 2 MB margin means the driver gets whatever happened to be left over.
 *
 * This is what killed 1080p. Our boot log reports
 *     [probe] mem total=3189 MB used=3185 MB free=3 MB
 * and the process then died INSIDE eglSwapBuffers on the first 1920x1080
 * present -- a driver allocation failing in the compositor path, which takes
 * the system down rather than returning an error we could see. The GPU arena
 * being 90% empty at the time was irrelevant: wrong pool.
 *
 *     1920x1080 = 7.9 MB/buffer  (23.7 MB triple-buffered)
 *     1280x720  = 3.5 MB/buffer  (10.5 MB triple-buffered)
 *
 * which is why 720p survived on scraps and 1080p did not.
 *
 * 192 MB covers a triple-buffered 1080p swapchain, the game's render textures,
 * GPU command buffers and texture staging, with margin. Taken straight from the
 * CloverPit port, which runs 1920x1080 in handheld on this exact value -- proof
 * that the compositor downscales a 1080p buffer to the 720p panel quite happily
 * once the driver can actually allocate it.
 *
 * If the game later OOMs on the MANAGED side instead, this is the knob to trade
 * back. Note we also freed 384 MB by right-sizing OC_POOL_BYTES above, so newlib
 * is still ahead of where it was. */
/* THE ROOM THREE: raised 192 -> 256.
 *
 * 192 was the Deus Ex GO value and it is already the post-fix number -- the
 * "stopped claiming memory" change is INHERITED here, not something still to
 * do. If 1080p still fails on this title, the driver simply needs more than
 * DXGO did, which is plausible: this game ships ~1.19 GB of assets against
 * DXGO's ~300 MB, so more is resident at any moment, and 1080p costs 2.25x the
 * pixels of 720p across the swapchain and every render target.
 *
 * Budget at 1080p, for the allocations that come from the PROCESS POOL rather
 * than the GPU arena:
 *     triple-buffered swapchain   1920*1080*4*3  = 23.7 MB
 *     depth/stencil               1920*1080*4    =  8.3 MB
 *     engine render targets                      ~ 8-20 MB
 *     nvmap handles, command buffers, staging    ~ tens of MB
 * 256 MB leaves comfortable headroom over that without being reckless.
 *
 * COST: newlib loses 64 MB. That is affordable here -- right-sizing
 * OC_POOL_BYTES from 896 to 512 already returned 384 MB, so newlib is still
 * well ahead of where it was before either change.
 *
 * IF THIS IS THE WRONG POOL, the log says so plainly; do not guess, the DXGO
 * port lost three rounds to exactly that:
 *   [probe] mem total=.. used=.. free=N MB   <- N is what the driver may use.
 *                                              Small N (single/low double
 *                                              digits) => raise this constant.
 *                                              Healthy N => the fault is
 *                                              elsewhere, leave it alone.
 *   [gpua] GPU arena reserved: X MB (asked 1152 MB)
 *                                           <- X < asked means newlib could not
 *                                              hand over a contiguous block:
 *                                              this constant is now TOO HIGH.
 * If the game instead OOMs on the managed side, trade back down. */

/* ---- app identity reported to game code -----------------------------------
 * Surfaced as PackageInfo.versionName / versionCode and hence
 * UnityEngine.Application.version.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT "1.0.0": The Room Three checks its own version against a remote
 * minimum. Deca.RemoteVersioning.RemoteVersioningConfig::ValidateAppVersion
 * (il2cpp 0x1632010) does, in effect:
 *
 *     Version.TryParse(Application.version, out app);
 *     if (app < RecommendedVersion) shouldUpdate = true;
 *     if (app < MinVersion)         mustUpdate  = true;
 *
 * and TitleScreenViewController raises the "THE ROOM THREE UPDATED! Your game
 * version is out of date." popup on the result. With the old placeholder
 * "1.0.0" that comparison always failed, so the popup reappeared every time
 * CONTINUE returned to the title screen.
 *
 * APP_VERSION_NAME below is the REAL versionName, dumped from the base APK.
 * Reporting the truth is preferable to an override: the game runs fine on a
 * phone at this version, and anything else that reads app identity (analytics,
 * crash keys) then sees something coherent.
 *
 * If you ever need to re-derive it:
 *     aapt dump badging base.apk | grep -E "versionName|versionCode"
 * It is NOT recoverable from classes*.dex -- every BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME in
 * there belongs to a third-party library. (A "2.5.6" string does appear in the
 * dex pool, but do not trust that: the pool is sorted lexicographically, so it
 * sits next to 21.0.0 / 2022.3.67f2 purely by sort order, not association.)
 *
 * RESIDUAL RISK, worth knowing if the popup ever comes back. The min and
 * recommended versions come from Firebase Remote Config, which is stubbed in
 * this port -- so the game compares against whatever defaults are baked into
 * the shipped RemoteVersioningConfig asset, NOT against what a real phone gets
 * from the live service. Those are normally <= the shipping version, but if the
 * baked default happens to exceed it the popup will persist even with a
 * truthful version. In that case set APP_VERSION_NAME to "99.0.0" as a
 * deliberate override -- this port can never update itself, so "already
 * current" is a defensible answer. Debug.LogWarning is not routed to debug.log,
 * so the thresholds cannot be read from a boot log to check in advance.
 *
 * APP_VERSION_CODE is still a guess -- the dump gave versionName only. Nothing
 * observed reads it, but the aapt line above prints both if you want it exact.
