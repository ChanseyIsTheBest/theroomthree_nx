/* r3_video.h -- full-screen movie playback for The Room Three's endings.
 *
 * The game uses Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie, which on Android is handed to
 * android.media.MediaPlayer through
 *     com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer.showVideoPlayer(String, IIIZII)Z
 * There is no MediaPlayer here, so jni_fake.c answers that call itself and
 * routes it to r3_video_play(). See r3_video.c for the full derivation.
 *
 * Set R3_VIDEO to 0 in config.h to drop the feature: every function below
 * compiles to an empty stub needing no ffmpeg header and no ffmpeg library, and
 * the port behaves exactly as it did before -- endings silently skipped.
 *
 * MIT. Decoder and GL path derived from the CloverPit NX port.
