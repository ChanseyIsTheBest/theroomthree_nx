/* r3_video.c -- full-screen movie playback for The Room Three's ending clips.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED
 * ------------------
 * The Room Three shows its four endings with Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie, the
 * legacy API -- NOT UnityEngine.Video. Its build contains no
 * UnityEngine.VideoModule.dll at all (checked against the 36 images in the
 * IL2CPP metadata), so there is no VideoPlayer to hook and no in-engine
 * fallback.
 *
 * On Android that API lands in UnityPlayerJavaWrapper::ShowVideoPlayer, which
 * attaches to the JVM and calls
 *
 *     com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer.showVideoPlayer(String path, IIIZII) -> Z
 *
 * handing the whole job to android.media.MediaPlayer. There is no MediaPlayer
 * here, so without this the endings are simply skipped.
 *
 * That JNI call is the hook, and it is much cheaper than patching libunity: the
 * path arrives as the first argument, jni_fake.c intercepts it, and the engine
 * is told the video started. libunity is not modified at all.
 *
 * HOW IT PLAYS
 * ------------
 *   - r3_video_play(path) opens the .mp4 and decodes it with ffmpeg on its own
 *     thread, publishing finished frames as packed YUV420 planes;
 *   - r3_video_draw(), called from the eglSwapBuffers wrapper in
 *     unity_imports.c, uploads the newest frame into three GL_LUMINANCE
 *     textures and draws one letterboxed quad, converting YUV to RGB in the
 *     shader;
 *   - r3_video_mix_audio() folds the clip's audio into the FMOD pump.
 *
 * The engine keeps running underneath, because ShowVideoPlayer does NOT block:
 * it makes the JNI call and returns the boolean (verified by disassembly -- the
 * only calls it makes are string handling, apkStat, the ScopedJNI attach, and
 * the JavaMethod<bool> invoke). On Android the game pauses only because the
 * video Activity comes to the front, which has no equivalent here. So this
 * draws over the top instead. If the game advances behind the clip, that is the
 * one behavioural difference from Android, and it is confined to the few
 * seconds of an ending cutscene.
 *
 * Everything degrades to the previous behaviour -- endings skipped, no hang --
 * if the file is missing, ffmpeg lacks the codec, or R3_VIDEO is 0.
 *
 * Decoder, GL upload/draw, colour handling and audio mixing are carried over
 * essentially unchanged from the CloverPit NX port (MIT, same lineage). What is
 * specific here is the trigger, and that the clip is named by an explicit path
 * rather than identified by duration from a manifest.
 *
 * This software may be modified and distributed under the terms
 * of the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for details.

 * enforces the include; this catches it even if that is not run. */

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------- clips */

/* CloverPit had to hunt its clips: they lived inside data.unity3d and were
 * identified by matching VideoClip.length against what the engine asked for.
 * None of that applies here -- showVideoPlayer hands us the exact path, and The
 * Room Three ships its endings as four ordinary .mp4 files:
 *
 *   assets/4-3/Bad Ending.mp4      assets/4-3/Good Ending A.mp4
 *   assets/4-3/Good Ending B.mp4   assets/4-3/Super Ending.mp4
 *
 * "4-3" is the only aspect-ratio folder in this build (the managed string
 * literals have "4-3" and no "16-9"), so every ending is 4:3 and the draw path
 * letterboxes it into the 16:9 framebuffer. */
