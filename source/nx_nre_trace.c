/* nx_nre_trace.c -- take a managed stack trace at the point a
 * NullReferenceException is raised.
 *
 * This build ships no il2cpp.usym, so Unity prints the exception with no stack
 * (debug.log: three blank lines after "NullReferenceException: Object reference
 * not set to an instance of an object."). This module hooks the raiser itself
 * and logs the return addresses, which tools/il2cpp_symbols.py turns back into
 * C# method names.
 *
 * See nx_patch_r3.h (R3_NRE_*) for the derivation of the target, why a
 * splice is safe there, and -- importantly -- why the managed caller's address
 * is at [sp] rather than in x30.
 *
 * Reading the output:
 *
 *   [nre] #1 NullReferenceException raised
 *   [nre]   frame 0  il2cpp+0x16bcd14
 *   [nre]   frame 1  il2cpp+0x16c1f80
 *   ...
 *   tools/il2cpp_symbols.py sym dump.cs 0x16bcd14 0x16c1f80
 *
 * Frame 0 is exact -- it is the return address the codegen stub pushed, so it
 * points into the method that dereferenced null. Frames 1+ come from walking
 * the x29 frame-pointer chain and are BEST EFFORT: il2cpp does not guarantee a
 * frame pointer in every compiled method, so a short or truncated chain is
 * normal and a missing frame does not mean the walk is broken. Trust frame 0.

 * `sub sp, sp, #0x20`, and `stp xzr, x30` must store the ORIGINAL x30 -- which
