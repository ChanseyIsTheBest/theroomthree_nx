# The Room Three — Nintendo Switch port (Unity 2021.3 / IL2CPP wrapper)
 
This is a native wrapper / loader that runs the original ARM64 Android build of
The Room Three on Switch homebrew. It contains no game code and no game assets —
it loads the game's own libraries and recreates, natively, the thin Android/JNI
layer the Unity engine expects.
 
## Install & run
 
You need files from The Room Three V.1.08.
 
Put the `.nro` in any folder under `sdmc:/switch/` and place your game files next
to it — the loader finds its folder at runtime, so the name is up to you:
 
```
sdmc:/switch/theroom3
├── theroom3_nx.nro
├── libmain.so  libunity.so  libil2cpp.so   <- from your APK: lib/arm64-v8a/
├── cursor.png                              <- optional
└── assets/                                 <- your APK's assets/
```

Launch via title override (hold R while starting an installed game) or a
forwarder.
 
Optionally drop a `cursor.png` (up to 64×64, transparency respected, top-left
pixel is the hotspot) in the same folder to replace the on-screen cursor with
your own.
 
## Controls
 
| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Touchscreen** | Direct multi-touch — the native fit for this game |
| **+** | Toggle the on-screen cursor |
| **–** | Toggle gyro pointing (tilt/turn the controller to aim) |
| **Left stick** | Move the cursor |
| **L / R** | Recenter the cursor to the middle of the screen (helps gyro aiming) |
| **A / ZR / ZL** | Tap / confirm (ZL and ZR let you play one-handed) |
| **B** | Android Back |
| **D-pad up / down** | Adjust sensitivity of whatever is driving the cursor |
 
The cursor is on by default when docked and off in handheld; `+`
overrides either way. A USB mouse works in both modes: move to control the
cursor, left-click to tap, and use the scroll wheel to change sensitivity — gyro
turns itself off while a mouse is connected. 

Your stick, mouse and gyro
sensitivities are remembered in `pointer.cfg` automatically after in-game
adjustment.
 
## Settings
 
`config.txt` is written next to the `.nro` on first launch, with the options
documented inline:
 
```
handheld_res 720     # 720 or 1080
docked_res   1080    # 720 or 1080
framerate    60      # 60 or 30
```
 
Both modes accept either resolution — 1080 in handheld is supersampled down to
the panel, 720 docked is upscaled. The game ships locked to 30; `framerate`
rewrites the branch it picks that from, in either direction.
 
## Building
 
Requires devkitPro with the `switch-dev` group plus these portlibs:
 
```
pacman -S switch-dev
pacman -S switch-mesa switch-libdrm_nouveau switch-sdl2 switch-libpng switch-zlib
pacman -S switch-ffmpeg      # ending cutscenes; set R3_VIDEO 0 in config.h to skip
 
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
make                        # -> theroom3_nx.nro
```
 
## Credits
 
The loader/shim infrastructure (`so_util`, `libc_shim`, `jni_fake`, `unity_jni`,
`opensles`, `nx_pointer`, diagnostics) derives from the open-source Switch
`.so`-loader lineage — Andy Nguyen, fgsfds and ChanseyIsTheBest, building on
TheOfficialFloW's Vita/Switch loader tradition — reaching this project via the
Zookeeper DX and PvZ Fusion ports, with the Hitman GO port as the template and
the CloverPit port as the reference for video decoding. All MIT-licensed. Thanks
to everyone in that lineage for making this approach possible.
